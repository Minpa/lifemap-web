## 🚀 Railway Deployment

### Auto-Deploy Status
Railway is configured to auto-deploy from GitHub when changes are pushed to `main` branch.

**Expected Behavior:**
1. ✅ GitHub webhook triggers Railway build
2. ✅ Railway pulls latest code from `main`
3. ✅ Nixpacks builds the Next.js app
4. ✅ Railway deploys to production
5. ✅ Service Worker is served from `/sw.js`

### Check Deployment Status

**Option 1: Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Open your project
3. Check the "Deployments" tab
4. Look for the latest deployment with commit `57899a2`

**Option 2: Check Your Domain**
1. Visit your Railway domain (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
2. Open DevTools → Application → Service Workers
3. Verify Service Worker is registered
4. Check console for: `✅ Service Worker registered successfully`

---

## 🔍 Verify Deployment

### 1. Check Service Worker
```
Open: https://your-app.railway.app
DevTools → Application → Service Workers
Expected: Service Worker registered at /sw.js
```

### 2. Check API Endpoints
```bash
# Test sync endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/location/sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-user-id: test-user" \
  -d '{"points": []}'

# Expected: {"success":true,"syncedCount":0,"failedCount":0}
```

### 3. Check Static Files
```
Open: https://your-app.railway.app/sw.js
Expected: Service Worker JavaScript code
```

### 4. Test Location Tracking
1. Visit your app
2. Click "추적 시작" (Start Tracking)
3. Allow location permissions
4. Verify tracking starts
5. Check map for current position marker

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails

**Check Railway Logs:**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click on failed deployment
5. Check build logs for errors

**Common Issues:**
- Missing environment variables
- Build timeout
- Dependency installation errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Rebuild manually
railway up
```

### If Service Worker Doesn't Register

**Check:**
1. Is HTTPS enabled? (Railway provides HTTPS by default)
2. Is `/sw.js` accessible?
3. Any console errors?

**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache
- Hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check Railway logs for errors

### If API Endpoints Don't Work

**Check:**
1. Are routes deployed correctly?
2. Any server errors in Railway logs?
3. CORS configuration?

**Solution:**
- Check Railway logs
- Verify environment variables
- Test endpoints with curl
