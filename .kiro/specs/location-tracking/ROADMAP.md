## üöÄ Remaining Work Breakdown

### **PHASE 1: Core Functionality (MVP)** 
*Goal: Get basic tracking working with UI*

#### Task 5: Server Sync Service (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Why**: Without this, data is lost when user clears browser cache
- [ ] 5.1 API endpoints for location sync
  - POST /api/location/sync - Upload location points
  - GET /api/location/points - Download location history
  - Authentication middleware
  - Rate limiting
  
- [ ] 5.2 Client-side sync service
  - Batch upload (max 100 points)
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Offline queueing
  
- [ ] 5.3 Automatic sync scheduling
  - Sync every 30 seconds when online
  - Sync on app close/background
  - Sync when queue reaches threshold

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Dependencies**: CloudKit authentication (‚úÖ done)
**Files to Create**:
- `app/api/location/sync/route.ts`
- `app/api/location/points/route.ts`
- `lib/location/syncService.ts`

---

#### Task 6: Map Visualization (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Why**: Users need to see their tracks
- [ ] 6.1 Track renderer service

  - Mapbox layer for tracks
  - Track simplification algorithm
  
- [ ] 6.2 Current position marker
  - Pulsing marker for current location
  - Accuracy circle visualization

**Files to Create**:
- `lib/location/trackRenderer.ts`
- `components/map/LocationTrackLayer.tsx`

---

#### Task 7: Tracking Controls UI (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Why**: Users need a way to start/stop tracking
- [ ] 7.1 TrackingControls component
  - Start/stop button
  - Tracking status indicator
  - Today's statistics (distance, duration, points)
  
- [ ] 7.2 Permission request UI
  - Permission request dialog
  - Instructions for enabling
  - Handle denied state
  
- [ ] 7.3 Settings panel
  - Enable/disable tracking toggle
  - Sync status display
  - Data management options

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours
**Dependencies**: Location store (‚úÖ done)
**Files to Create**:
- `components/location/TrackingControls.tsx`
- `components/location/PermissionDialog.tsx`
- `app/settings/location/page.tsx`

---

### **PHASE 2: Mobile & Background Support**
*Goal: Make it work like a real mobile app*

#### Task 8: Service Worker for Background Sync (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Why**: Enable tracking when app is in background
- [ ] 8.1 Service Worker with sync handlers
  - Register Service Worker
  - Sync event handler
  - Periodic sync for background tracking
  
- [ ] 8.2 Background location capture
  - Request location in Service Worker

  - Error handling

**Estimated Effort**: 5-6 hours
**Dependencies**: PWA setup (‚úÖ done)
**Files to Create**:
- `public/sw.js`
- `lib/location/serviceWorkerManager.ts`

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: Background Geolocation API has limited browser support. May need to use Capacitor plugin for native apps.

---

#### Task 13: Data Restoration on New Device (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Why**: Users switching devices need their history
- [ ] 13.1 Initial data download
  - Download all points on first login
  - Progress indicator
  - Populate IndexedDB cache
  
- [ ] 13.2 Incremental sync
  - Download only new points
  - Sync since last device access

  - Visual distinction on map
  
- [ ] 11.2 Distance-based filtering
  - Only save if moved > 10m
  - Reduce stationary point spam

**Estimated Effort**: 2 hours
**Dependencies**: Task 2 (‚úÖ done)

## üéØ Quick Start: Next 3 Tasks

If you want to get something working ASAP, do these in order:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Task 7.1: Build TrackingControls Component (2 hours)
**Why first**: You need a UI to test everything else
- Simple start/stop button
- Shows tracking status
- Displays today's stats

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Task 6.2: Add Current Position Marker (1 hour)
**Why second**: Visual feedback that tracking is working
- Pulsing dot on map
- Updates in real-time

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Task 5.1-5.2: Implement Server Sync (4 hours)
**Why third**: Persist data so it's not lost
- API endpoints
- Client-side sync service

**After these 3 tasks**: You'll have a working MVP that you can test on your phone!

## üîß Technical Debt & Considerations

### Browser Compatibility
- **Geolocation API**: ‚úÖ Widely supported
- **IndexedDB**: ‚úÖ Widely supported
- **Background Geolocation**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited support (iOS Safari restrictions)
- **Service Worker**: ‚úÖ Good support in modern browsers

### Mobile App Considerations
For full background tracking on iOS, you may need:
- Capacitor or React Native wrapper
- Native background location plugin
- App Store approval for location usage

### CloudKit Integration
- Location data will be stored in CloudKit
- Need to create CloudKit record type: `LocationPoint`
- Fields: `userId`, `encryptedData`, `timestamp`, `synced`

### Security Notes
- ‚úÖ Client-side encryption implemented
- ‚úÖ Zero-knowledge architecture (server can't read raw data)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to add CloudKit security rules
