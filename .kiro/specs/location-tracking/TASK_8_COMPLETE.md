# Task 8 Complete: Service Worker for Background Sync

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 8.1 Service Worker with Sync Handlers ✅
**File:** `public/sw.js`

**Features:**
- ✅ Background sync event handler
- ✅ Periodic sync event handler (15-minute intervals)
- ✅ Message handler for main thread communication
- ✅ IndexedDB access from Service Worker
- ✅ Batch sync (max 100 points)
- ✅ Network-first caching strategy for API calls
- ✅ Cache-first strategy for static assets
- ✅ Automatic cache cleanup on activation

**Sync Events:**
- `sync` - Triggered when network is available
- `periodicsync` - Triggered every 15 minutes (if supported)
- `message` - Handles commands from main thread

### 8.2 Service Worker Manager ✅
**File:** `lib/location/serviceWorkerManager.ts`

**Functions:**
- ✅ `registerServiceWorker()` - Register SW with auto-activation
- ✅ `unregisterServiceWorker()` - Clean unregistration
- ✅ `requestBackgroundSync()` - Request one-time background sync
- ✅ `requestPeriodicSync()` - Request periodic sync (15 min intervals)
- ✅ `cancelPeriodicSync()` - Cancel periodic sync
- ✅ `syncNowViaSW()` - Immediate sync via SW
- ✅ `listenToServiceWorker()` - Listen for SW messages
- ✅ `getServiceWorkerStatus()` - Check SW registration status
- ✅ Feature detection for Background Sync API
- ✅ Feature detection for Periodic Sync API

### 8.3 Service Worker Initializer Component ✅
**File:** `components/ServiceWorkerInitializer.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Automatic SW registration on app load
- ✅ Periodic sync registration when tracking starts
- ✅ Message listener for SW events
- ✅ Location capture on SW request
- ✅ Sync status refresh on sync complete
- ✅ Integration with auth and location stores

## 🎯 How It Works

### Background Sync Flow

```
1. User starts tracking
   ↓
2. ServiceWorkerInitializer registers SW
   ↓
3. SW registers periodic sync (15 min)
   ↓
4. User closes app or switches tabs
   ↓
5. Browser triggers periodic sync
   ↓
6. SW sends message to main thread: "REQUEST_LOCATION_UPDATE"
   ↓
7. Main thread captures location (if app is open)
   ↓
8. SW syncs unsynced points to server
   ↓
9. SW sends message: "SYNC_COMPLETE"
   ↓
10. Main thread updates sync status
```

### Sync Triggers

1. **Automatic (every 30 seconds)** - Via locationSyncService
2. **Background Sync** - When app is backgrounded
3. **Periodic Sync** - Every 15 minutes (if supported)
4. **On Close** - Before page unload
5. **On Online** - When network reconnects
6. **Threshold** - When 50+ unsynced points
7. **Manual** - User clicks "Sync Now" button

## 📁 Files Created

```
public/
└── sw.js                                    ✅ Service Worker

lib/location/
└── serviceWorkerManager.ts                  ✅ SW Manager

components/
└── ServiceWorkerInitializer.tsx             ✅ SW Initializer
```

---

## 🚀 Integration Steps

### Step 1: Add ServiceWorkerInitializer to Layout

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx

import { ServiceWorkerInitializer } from '@/components/ServiceWorkerInitializer';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="ko">
      <body>
        <ServiceWorkerInitializer />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Verify Service Worker Registration

Open DevTools → Application → Service Workers

You should see:
- ✅ Service Worker registered at `/sw.js`
- ✅ Status: activated and running

### Step 3: Test Background Sync

1. Start tracking
2. Switch to another tab
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Return to app
5. Check console for: `✅ Background sync complete`

## 🌐 Browser Support

### Service Worker
- ✅ Chrome 40+
- ✅ Firefox 44+
- ✅ Safari 11.1+
- ✅ Edge 17+

### Background Sync API
- ✅ Chrome 49+
- ✅ Edge 79+
- ❌ Firefox (not supported)
- ❌ Safari (not supported)

### Periodic Background Sync API
- ✅ Chrome 80+
- ✅ Edge 80+
- ❌ Firefox (not supported)
- ❌ Safari (not supported)

**Fallback:** If Background Sync is not supported, the app falls back to regular sync via locationSyncService.

---

## ⚠️ Important Limitations

### 1. Geolocation API Not Available in Service Worker
**Issue:** The Geolocation API is not accessible in Service Worker context.

**Solution:** 
- SW sends message to main thread requesting location update
- Main thread captures location using Geolocation API
- Location is saved to IndexedDB
- SW syncs the saved points

**Impact:** Background location capture only works when app is open (but can be in background tab).

### 2. Periodic Sync Limitations
**Browser Restrictions:**
- Only works in Chrome/Edge
- Requires HTTPS
- Minimum interval: 12 hours (browser may override)
- Browser may throttle based on:
  - Battery level
  - Network conditions
  - User engagement with site

**Our Setting:** 15 minutes (browser may adjust)

### 3. Background Sync Reliability
**Factors Affecting Reliability:**
- Battery saver mode may disable sync
- Incognito mode doesn't support persistent sync
- Browser may delay sync if device is low on battery
- Sync may be skipped if user hasn't engaged with site recently

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Sync Intervals

```javascript
// Automatic sync (locationSyncService)
const AUTO_SYNC_INTERVAL = 30000; // 30 seconds

// Periodic sync (Service Worker)
const PERIODIC_SYNC_INTERVAL = 15 * 60 * 1000; // 15 minutes

// Threshold sync
const SYNC_THRESHOLD = 50; // points
```

### Batch Sizes

```javascript
// Max points per sync request
const MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 100;

// Max requests per minute
const RATE_LIMIT = 10;
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Service Worker Not Registering

**Check:**
1. Are you on HTTPS or localhost?
2. Is `/sw.js` accessible?
3. Any console errors?
4. Browser supports Service Workers?

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear browser cache
# Hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)
# Check DevTools → Application → Service Workers
```

### Background Sync Not Working

**Check:**
1. Is Background Sync API supported?
2. Is app in incognito mode? (not supported)
3. Is battery saver enabled?
4. Has user engaged with site recently?

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Check support
if ('sync' in ServiceWorkerRegistration.prototype) {
  console.log('Background Sync supported');
} else {
  console.log('Background Sync not supported - using fallback');
}
```

### Periodic Sync Not Triggering

**Check:**
1. Is Periodic Sync API supported? (Chrome/Edge only)
2. Is HTTPS enabled?
3. Has user granted permission?
4. Is battery level sufficient?

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Check support
if ('periodicSync' in ServiceWorkerRegistration.prototype) {
  console.log('Periodic Sync supported');
} else {
  console.log('Periodic Sync not supported');
}
```
