# Requirements Document - Real-Time Location Tracking

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing real-time location tracking in the LifeMap web application. The goal is to automatically capture and log the user's location data while they use the app, store it locally, and visualize it on the map with time-based color coding.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-Time Location Tracking

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to automatically track my location when I'm using it so that I can see where I've been without manual input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app THEN the system SHALL request location permissions
2. WHEN location permission is granted THEN the system SHALL start tracking the user's current position
3. WHEN the user moves THEN the system SHALL update their position every 30 seconds
4. WHEN location data is captured THEN the system SHALL include timestamp, coordinates, accuracy, speed, and heading
5. IF location permission is denied THEN the system SHALL show a message explaining why location access is needed
6. WHEN the app is in the foreground THEN location tracking SHALL be active

### Requirement 2: Location Data Storage

**User Story:** As a user, I want my location history to be stored locally so that my data remains private and accessible offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN location data is captured THEN the system SHALL store it in IndexedDB
2. WHEN storing location data THEN the system SHALL include all metadata (timestamp, accuracy, speed, etc.)
3. WHEN the database reaches 10,000 points THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up old data
4. IF storage fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times
5. WHEN the user is in guest mode THEN data SHALL only be stored locally
6. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN data SHALL be stored locally and optionally synced to iCloud

### Requirement 3: Map Visualization with Time-Based Colors

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my location history on the map with different colors representing different time periods so that I can understand my movement patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN location data exists THEN the system SHALL display it as a polyline on the map
2. WHEN displaying tracks THEN the system SHALL color-code them based on time:
   - Recent (< 1 hour): Bright cyan (#7fe3ff)
   - Today (< 24 hours): Green (#8af5c2)
   - This week (< 7 days): Yellow (#ffd166)
   - This month (< 30 days): Orange (#ff7aa2)
   - Older (> 30 days): Purple (#9d8cff)
3. WHEN the user zooms in THEN individual location points SHALL be visible
4. WHEN the user clicks a track segment THEN details SHALL be shown (time, speed, duration)
5. IF there are many points THEN the system SHALL use line simplification for performance

### Requirement 4: Background Tracking with Service Worker

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to continue tracking my location periodically even when I'm not actively using it so that I don't miss parts of my journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is installed as PWA THEN the system SHALL register a Service Worker
2. WHEN the app is in the background THEN the Service Worker SHALL request location every 15 minutes
3. WHEN background location is captured THEN it SHALL be stored in IndexedDB
4. IF the device is low on battery THEN background tracking frequency SHALL be reduced
5. WHEN the user returns to the app THEN new background data SHALL be displayed on the map
6. IF background tracking fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry

### Requirement 5: Location Tracking Controls

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control when location tracking is active so that I can preserve battery and privacy when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens settings THEN they SHALL see a "Location Tracking" toggle
2. WHEN tracking is enabled THEN the system SHALL show a visual indicator (pulsing dot)
3. WHEN the user disables tracking THEN location capture SHALL stop immediately
4. WHEN tracking is paused THEN existing data SHALL remain on the map
5. IF tracking is disabled for 7 days THEN the system SHALL send a reminder notification
6. WHEN the user enables tracking THEN it SHALL resume from the current location

### Requirement 6: Privacy and Permissions

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear information about how my location data is used so that I can make informed decisions about privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN location permission is requested THEN the system SHALL explain why it's needed
2. WHEN permission is denied THEN the system SHALL provide instructions to enable it
3. WHEN the user views privacy settings THEN they SHALL see what location data is stored
4. IF the user wants to delete location history THEN they SHALL be able to do so
5. WHEN location data is stored THEN it SHALL be encrypted at rest
6. IF the user is in a privacy zone THEN location SHALL NOT be recorded

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want location tracking to not drain my battery or slow down the app so that I can use it throughout the day.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking is active THEN battery usage SHALL be < 5% per hour
2. WHEN displaying tracks THEN the map SHALL render smoothly at 60fps
3. WHEN there are > 1000 points THEN the system SHALL use clustering or simplification
4. IF the device is low on battery THEN tracking frequency SHALL be reduced automatically
5. WHEN the app is idle THEN location requests SHALL be paused
6. WHEN the user is stationary THEN location updates SHALL be reduced

### Requirement 8: Location Accuracy and Quality

**User Story:** As a user, I want accurate location data so that my tracks reflect where I actually went.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting location THEN the system SHALL request high accuracy mode
2. WHEN location accuracy is poor (> 100m) THEN the point SHALL be marked as low quality
3. WHEN displaying tracks THEN low quality points SHALL be visually distinguished
4. IF GPS signal is lost THEN the system SHALL show a warning
5. WHEN accuracy improves THEN the system SHALL update the current position
6. IF a location point is clearly erroneous THEN it SHALL be filtered out

## Edge Cases and Constraints

### Edge Cases
- User denies location permission
- GPS signal is lost (tunnels, buildings)
- Device runs out of battery
- User travels very fast (airplane, train)
- User stays in one place for extended periods
- Browser tab is closed or crashes
- Device goes offline

### Constraints
- Browser geolocation API limitations
- Service Worker background sync limitations (15-30 min intervals)
- IndexedDB storage limits (typically 50MB-1GB)
- Battery consumption concerns
- Privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Must work on iOS Safari and Android Chrome

---

## Success Metrics

1. **Tracking Accuracy**: > 95% of points within 50m of actual location
2. **Battery Usage**: < 5% per hour of active tracking
3. **Data Capture Rate**: > 90% of user's journey captured
4. **Performance**: Map renders at 60fps with 10,000+ points
5. **User Adoption**: > 70% of users enable location tracking

## Dependencies

- Browser Geolocation API
- Service Worker API
- IndexedDB
- Mapbox GL JS
- PWA installation
- Background Sync API (optional)

---

## Out of Scope

- Native iOS/Android app (true 24/7 background tracking)
- Automatic activity detection (walking, driving, etc.)
- Route optimization or navigation
- Social features (sharing live location)
- Historical data import from other apps
