- ✅ Sync status display
- ✅ Permission request dialog with instructions
- ✅ Settings page with:
  - Enable/disable tracking toggle
  - Auto-sync toggle
  - Manual sync button
  - Storage statistics
  - Data management (delete all)

## 📊 Current State

### What's Working Now
1. **Location Tracking**
   - GPS position capture with accuracy filtering
   - Distance-based filtering (only save if moved > 10m)
   - Client-side AES-256-GCM encryption
   - Local storage in IndexedDB

2. **Server Sync**
   - Automatic sync every 30 seconds
   - Batch upload (max 100 points)
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Offline queueing
   - Sync on app close/background

3. **Map Visualization**
   - Time-based color gradient for tracks
   - Current position marker with accuracy circle
   - Interactive tracks (hover for details, click to zoom)
   - Track simplification for performance

4. **User Interface**
   - Tracking control panel with stats
   - Permission request dialog
   - Settings page for data management
   - Sync status indicators

### What's Missing
- ❌ Service Worker for background tracking (Task 8)
- ❌ Performance optimizations (Task 9)
- ❌ Privacy features (zones, export, deletion) (Task 10)
- ❌ Accuracy filtering UI (Task 11)
- ❌ User onboarding (Task 12)
- ❌ Data restoration on new device (Task 13)
- ❌ Testing (Task 14)
- ❌ Documentation (Task 15)

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Next Task: Integrate Components
Before moving to Task 8, we need to integrate the components we just created:

1. **Add TrackingControls to Map Page**
   - Import and render `<TrackingControls />` in the map page
   - Add permission dialog integration
   - Wire up track visualization

2. **Test the MVP**
   - Start tracking
   - Verify location points are captured
   - Check sync is working
   - Verify map visualization

### After Integration: Task 8 (Service Worker)
- Background location tracking
- Periodic sync in background
- PWA offline support

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open the Map Page
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Test Tracking
1. Click "추적 시작" (Start Tracking) button
2. Allow location permissions when prompted
3. Move around (or simulate movement)
4. Watch the map update with your track
5. Check the statistics panel

### 4. Test Sync
1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
2. Watch for POST requests to `/api/location/sync`
3. Should sync every 30 seconds
4. Check sync status in the control panel

### 5. Test Settings
1. Navigate to `/settings/location`
2. Toggle tracking on/off
3. Toggle auto-sync on/off
4. Check storage statistics
5. Test manual sync button

## 💡 Notes

### API Endpoints
The API endpoints are currently using mock storage. To persist data to CloudKit:
1. Update `app/api/location/sync/route.ts` to save to CloudKit
2. Update `app/api/location/points/route.ts` to fetch from CloudKit
3. Add CloudKit record type: `LocationPoint`

### Authentication
The API endpoints expect `x-user-id` header. Update to use proper auth:
1. Extract user ID from session/JWT
2. Add middleware for auth validation
3. Update client to send auth headers

### Rate Limiting
Currently using in-memory rate limiting. For production:
1. Use Redis for distributed rate limiting
2. Add per-user quotas
3. Add monitoring and alerts
